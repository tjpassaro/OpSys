1) Read file
	- Processes are put into a queue which dispenses processes as they 'arrive'
2) Start simulation
	- Processes at time 0 are placed into I/O, Waiting, and Ready holders
	- Time starts incrementing
	- First print statements are outputted
3) Increment Timer
	- Increment up to the next action
	- Make appropriate changes to queues
	- Update process wait times
4) Finish
	- Final outputs
	- Rerun with next algorithm
